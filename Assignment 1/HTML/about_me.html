        I went to the amazon rainforest and it was once in a lifetime experience. 
        I saw numerous animals and my favorite part was chasing spider monkeys.
        The experience was so amazing and it made me appreciate our nature more.

        I really like this restaurant located on Newbury Street in Boston. It has the best greek food in town in my opinion. 
        The pork souvla is my favorite brunch dish there. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes greek food.

        One of my favorite foods is steak. I love the taste of steak especially when it is cooked medium rare.
        I like to eat steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My favorite steakhouse is called texas roadhouse.
